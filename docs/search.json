The spread from median (Q2) to lowest point is 0.27 million while the spread from Q2 to highest point 0.73 million. This indicates business faces relative low downside risk, as the fluctuations below Q2 are smaller.In contrast, the upside potential is significant, given the larger spread above Q2. Business should investigate the underlying factors that contributed to months where total sales exceeded Q3. If these success drivers are replicable, they should be integrated into a long-term business strategy.",

Particular attention should be paid to the quantity of sales returns, as the returned amounts are signicant - even though most category have returns below 10 percents of quantity sold, except for Games and Toys.\nTo visualize the potential loss, sales return have been monetized.

Those hints include:\n\nThe columns StockCode, Quantity and UnitPrice are jointly used to record business expenses (ie, commission, postage, bank chages), sales and sales return.\nStockCode is assigned to business expenses.

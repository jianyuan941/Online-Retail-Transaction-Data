[Online Retail Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/online-retail-transaction-data/data) The dataset contains online retail transaction records from a UK-based online retail business. A Business health analysis was conducted to assess the company’s long-term sustainability.\n\n```{r}\n#| eval: false\n#| include: false\n\ndftest <- data.frame(\n  Name = c(\"R\",\"Excel\", \"Tableau Public\"),\n  link = c(\n    'N/A',\n    '<a href=\"\" target=\"_blank\">TBC</a>',\n    '<a href=\"\" target=\"_blank\">TBC</a>'),\n  stringsAsFactors = FALSE\n)\n\nkable(dftest,escape = FALSE)\n\n```\n\n# Body\n\n## Overall Overview of Business Sales\n\n```{r}\np1\n```\n\nGraph above shows a stable stream of income from month Dec 2010 to Dec 2011. Business revenue peaked in November 2011 with 1.46 million and reach the lowest point in December 2011 at 0.62 million. Total monthly Quantity sold remains above 30k units regardless product categories.\n\n```{r}\np2\n```\n\nMonthly sales distribution shows center 50% of monthly revenue values fall within 0.67 million to 0.78 million. The spread from median (Q2) to lowest point is 0.27 million while the spread from Q2 to highest point 0.73 million. This indicates business faces relative low downside risk, as the fluctuations below Q2 are smaller.In contrast, the upside potential is significant, given the larger spread above Q2. Business should investigate the underlying factors that contributed to months where total sales exceeded Q3. If these success drivers are replicable, they should be integrated into a long-term business strategy.\n\n## Quantity Sold and Sales Returns Analysis\n\n```{r}\n#data calculation from sales.qmd\nread_file(\"total_quantity_sold_and_stock_return_by_category.rds\") %>% \n  group_by(category, type) %>% \n  mutate(\n    total_quantity = sum(total_quantity)\n  ) %>% \n  distinct() %>% \n   barchart_ggv2(.,category, total_quantity, fill = type, stack = F)+\n  coord_flip()+\n  labs(\n    title = \"Overview: Total Quantity Sold and Sales Returns by Category\"\n  )+\n  theme_function(title_size = 12)+\n  scale_y_continuous_function(0,2800000,m)+\n  geom_text_function(repel = F, stack = F, vjust = 0.5, hjust = -0.25, label = comma(total_quantity))\n\n```\n\nThe graph above provide an overview of the contribution of product categories to business's revenue and corresponding sales returns. Particular attention should be paid to the quantity of sales returns, as the returned amounts are signicant - even though most category have returns below 10 percents of quantity sold, except for Games and Toys.\n\nTo visualize the potential loss, sales return have been monetized. The calculation base on:\n\n`average Sale Price per unit * Quantity of Sale Returns`\n\n(Note: Cost of goods sold is unavailable in the dataset.)\n\nResult as per below:\n\n```{r}\n#calculation from sales.qmd\nread_file(\"losses_from_return_table.rds\") %>% \n    kbl(caption = \"Losses Incurred from Sales Returns\") %>% \n  kable_styling()\n```\n\nTable above shows losses incurred in each category. Result indicates total potential revenue from Dec 2010 to Dec 2011 is 0.66 million, which is similar to busines's average monthly revenue. It is hoped that this demontration will capture the attention of business owner and prompt action to investigate the underlying causes.\n\n### Issues Discovered from the Data\n\n#### Issue: Database structure\n\nData uncovers hints of structural weaknesses in database, casting doubt on the quality and reliability of data analysis. Those hints include:\n\n1.  The columns `StockCode`, `Quantity` and `UnitPrice` are jointly used to record business expenses (ie, commission, postage, bank chages), sales and sales return.\n2.  `StockCode` is assigned to business expenses. (ie, commission, postage, bank charges)\n3.  Product descriptions in `Description`are inconsistent.\n4.  There is no category labeling for stock items.\n\n### Issue: Irregular Amount of Write Off Goods\n\n```{R}\nread_file(\"Total Wastage.rds\") %>% \n  barchart_ggv2(\n    data = .,\n    x_col = category,\n    y_col = total_wastage,\n    stack = F,\n    fill_color = category\n  )+\n  coord_flip()+\n  labs(\n    title = \"Overview: Total Write Off Goods in Units (Dec 2010 to Dec 2011)\"\n  )+\n  theme_function(\n    title_size = 12, \n    legend = F,\n    margin_plot = margin(t=20, b=20, r=20,l=10)\n    )+\n  geom_text_function(repel = F, hjust = -0.5, \n                     label = paste0(\n                       comma(total_wastage, accuracy = 1),\n                       \" units\")\n                     )+\n  scale_y_continuous_function(0, 100000, suffix = K)\n\n```\n\nThe graph above shows 163k units of goods in total were write off from December 2010 to December 2011. The business should take note, as the number of write offs exceeds than the highest recorded sales within the time frame.\n\nDistribution of write offs to months as per below:\n\n#### Monthly Distribution of Lost Goods\n\n```{R}\nread_file(\"lost_good_per_month.rds\") %>% \n  linechart_gg(.,month_year, total)+\n  labs(\n    title = \"Lost Goods by Month\"\n  )+\n  scale_y_continuous_function(\n    start_range = 0,\n    end_range = 17000,\n    suffix = K\n  )+\n  theme_function(\n    x_label_position = element_text(angle = 45, vjust = 0.5),\n    margin_y_title = margin(r=10),\n    margin_x_title = margin(t=10)\n  )+\n  geom_text_function(\n    repel = T,\n    label = total,\n    vjust = -0.8\n  )\n\n```\n\nAs illustrated in the graph above, loss of goods happened across all months. The number of losses ranging from as low as 2480 units to as high as 15,992 units. The business should conduct a thorough investigation and strengthen the existing inventory management system to prevent further losses.\n\n#### Monthly Distribution of Obsolete Goods\n\n```{r}\nread_file(\"obsolete_good.rds\") %>% \n  linechart_gg(.,month_year, total)+\n  scale_y_continuous_function(\n    start_range = 0,\n    end_range = 30000,\n    suffix = K\n  )+\n  labs(\n    title = \"Obsolete Goods by Month\"\n  )+\n  theme_function(\n    x_label_position = element_text(angle = 45, vjust = 0.5),\n    margin_y_title = margin(r=10),\n    margin_x_title = margin(t=10)\n  )+\n  geom_text_function(\n    repel = T,\n    label = total,\n    vjust = -0.8\n  )\n\n```\n\nGraph above shows that goods were discarded across all months. The number of discards raised concerns whether appropriate control were taken place before such actions were taken.\n\n#### Monthly Distribution of Defective goods\n\n```{r}\nread_file(\"defective_goods_by_month.rds\") %>% \n  linechart_gg(.,month_year, total)+\n  scale_y_continuous_function(\n    start_range = 0,\n    end_range = 30000,\n    suffix = K\n  )+\n  labs(\n    title = \"Defective Goods by month\"\n  )+\n  theme_function(\n    x_label_position = element_text(angle = 45, vjust = 0.5),\n    margin_y_title = margin(r=10),\n    margin_x_title = margin(t=10)\n  )+\n  geom_text_function(\n    label = total,\n    vjust = -0.8\n  )\n```\n\nThe graph above shows significant number of defective goods across all months. An investigation should be conducted to uncover the underlying causes and establish preventive procedures to minimize future losses.\n\n## Issue: effectiveness of inventory management system\n\nThe write off amount raises concerns on the effectiveness of inventory management system. The business to revise and consider improvement in areas, such as:\n\n### Write off Policy\n\nPolicy should mandate management's consent before write off action. Obsolete goods should cross checked by 2 parties. Photo of obsolete goods and management's consent should be documented for audit purpose.\n\n### Clean Warehouse Policy\n\nPolicy should mandate monthly general cleaning, and prompt corrective actions must be taken if any signs of dampness are identified.\n\n### Reorder Point Policy\n\nPolicy should mandate a monthly product demand analysis to review the average demand of each product and establish or adjust the reorder point, in order to prevent overstocking of specific items.\n\nSample of calculation as per below:\n\n```{r}\n\n#Reorder_point = (average daily demand * lead time) + Safety Stock\n#safety_stock = Z * daily_demand_sd * sqrt(lead_time_days)\n#max_stock_level = monthly_demand + safety_stock\n\n#considering a postage delay of 1 month.
